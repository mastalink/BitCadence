# BitCadence Friction Inventory & Flow Surfaces Audit

This document presents a comprehensive, hands-on audit of user friction across every user-facing surface of BitCadence, evaluated against two non-technical personas:
- **Persona A (Gen-X / Older Adult):** An intelligent professional who was not raised on computers, feels intimidated by terminals, command prompts, environment variables, and cryptic error messages, and expects clear visual guidance.
- **Persona B (Smartphone-Native Teen):** A user raised entirely on iOS/Android who expects 1-tap actions, zero configuration, no manual copying of ports or URLs, and instant visual gratification.

## Part 1: Top 10 Friction Points

Ranked in order of severity and onboarding impact:

| Rank | Friction Point | Primary Cause | Impacted Personas | Severity |
|:---:|---|---|---|:---:|
| **1** | **The "Token & Gateway URL Dance"** | After double-clicking install, user must paste `mco_tok_...` and confirm `http://127.0.0.1:18789`. If lost, requires hunting in `.env`. | Persona A & B | **CRITICAL** |
| **2** | **"Keep This Black Window Open"** | Server launches as a raw terminal window. Closing it immediately terminates the backend. | Persona A & B | **CRITICAL** |
| **3** | **Connecting AI Models via MCP Requires Manual JSON Editing** | Users must find hidden paths like `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` and hand-write JSON blocks with paths and tokens. | Persona A & B | **CRITICAL** |
| **4** | **Jargon-Heavy Roles & Targeting** | Creating a job asks for a "Target Role" (`codex`, `claude`, `gemini`) without explaining what models or capabilities map to them. | Persona A & B | **HIGH** |
| **5** | **Running Background Workers Requires Terminal Daemon** | Making an agent execute tasks requires typing `mco listen --role codex --instance ...` in a separate open CMD window. | Persona A & B | **HIGH** |
| **6** | **Two Divergent Flow Builders** | The console has a Workflow Builder tab (`/console`), while `/flow` has an entirely separate Design Mode with different controls. | Persona A & B | **HIGH** |
| **7** | **Hidden Prerequisites for Approvals** | If a user registers an agent without an approver role, the Approve button fails with an obscure `403` error naming missing scopes. | Persona A | **MEDIUM** |
| **8** | **Authoring Recurring Loops Requires Hand-Editing YAML & Cron** | Setting up automated tasks requires editing `~/.mco/schedules.yaml` and memorizing 5-field cron syntax (`0 2 * * *`). | Persona A & B | **MEDIUM** |
| **9** | **Autonomous Scores Require Raw JSON Schema Authoring** | Using the Score Conductor requires authoring complex multi-level JSON files with explicit digests and capability arrays. | Persona A & B | **MEDIUM** |
| **10** | **Secret Store Keychain Discrepancy Across Platforms** | Seamless auto-unlock works on Windows Credential Manager, but silently halts on Linux/macOS unless an environment variable is exported. | Persona A | **MEDIUM** |

### Critical Friction Analysis: Elevation & Terminal Barriers

A focused audit of sidecar management and desktop operations reveals a severe divide between the GUI vision and operational reality:

#### 1. Tasks Blocked by "Run as Administrator" (UAC Elevation)
- **Installing Unattended Sidecars (`background = true` / S4U Logon):** Windows Task Scheduler refuses to register S4U logon tasks from unattended or standard user shells without Administrator elevation (`Access is denied`).
- **Local Service Accounts & ACL Hardening (`admin-pack.ps1`):** Creating dedicated service accounts and locking them out of private directories (`%USERPROFILE%`, personal documents, SSH keys) requires full local Administrator rights.
- **Port Narrowing & Firewall Rules:** Narrowing inbound ports to localhost (`127.0.0.1`) requires elevated PowerShell.
- **Impact on Personas:**
  - **Persona A (Older Adult):** Freezes at Windows UAC prompts. Cannot locate "Run as administrator" in the Start Menu and assumes system warnings indicate dangerous activity.
  - **Persona B (Teen):** Has never encountered an administrative prompt or terminal on mobile devices. Assumes the software is fundamentally broken when permission errors occur.

#### 2. Tasks Forcing Users into a Terminal / PowerShell
- **Desktop Shortcut & Dependency Setup:** `install_desktop.ps1` requires running a command line with explicit `-Python` paths.
- **Autostart at Sign-in:** `desktop_autostart.ps1` requires passing `-Pythonw "C:\path\to\pythonw.exe"`. Neither persona knows where their virtual environment's `pythonw.exe` binary resides.
- **Fleet Reconciliation (`fleet.toml`):** Changing worker allocation requires editing TOML syntax in Notepad and running `mco fleet apply`.
- **Silent Failure Diagnostics (Locked Logs & Duplicate Wakers):** When a worker appears "online" but fails silently, diagnosing locked files (`~/.mco/logs/<instance>.log`) or detecting duplicate wakers requires complex PowerShell commands (`Get-Process`, `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process`, `schtasks /query`).

## Part 3: Flow Surfaces Audit

### 1. Inventory of Flow Surfaces in BitCadence
The audit identified **five distinct surfaces** where workflows, execution flows, or Scores are displayed or authored:

1. **Overview Dashboard Stepper (`WorkflowStrip`):**
   - **Location:** `http://127.0.0.1:18789/console` (Overview tab).
   - **User Capabilities:** Read-only inspection. Groups active jobs by `workflow` name and renders a horizontal linear stepper showing step completion and current running task.
   - **Interaction:** Clicking any step opens the Job Detail Drawer. Cannot edit, re-order, or add steps.

2. **Console Workflow Builder (`WorkflowBuilder`):**
   - **Location:** `http://127.0.0.1:18789/console` (Workflows tab).
   - **User Capabilities:** Authoring and submitting DAGs. Users can add step cards, edit step IDs, select target roles, type prompt instructions, toggle approval gates, and export/import YAML.
   - **Interaction:** Visual card graph. Step connections can be added. Submits directly via `POST /api/workflows`.

3. **Flow Control Live Board (`/flow`):**
   - **Location:** `http://127.0.0.1:18789/flow` (Live board mode).
   - **User Capabilities:** Real-time operational mimic. Renders every job on the board with true `depends_on` arrows, animated dashed lines for active data flows, and color-coded status badges.
   - **Interaction:** Clicking nodes opens a side inspector where operators can directly click **Approve**, **Reject**, **Retry**, or **Cancel**. Strictly read-only for layout; graph structure is driven 100% by live database state.

4. **Flow Control Design Mode (`/flow`):**
   - **Location:** `http://127.0.0.1:18789/flow` (Design workflow mode).
   - **User Capabilities:** Visual CAD/drafting canvas. Features a grid canvas, step stencil rail, drag-to-place cards, and interactive circular port connectors (`then` → `needs`).
   - **Interaction:** Authoring only. Features local DAG validation, cycle detection, YAML export, and a separate red **Run workflow** confirmation button.

5. **Autonomous Score Conductor (`AutonomyLiveLookModal` & CLI):**
   - **Location:** `http://127.0.0.1:18789/console` (Live look modal) and `mco score`.
   - **User Capabilities:** Monitoring long-running autonomous Score contracts. Shows active goal stages, target agents, progress percentage, and lease status.
   - **Interaction:** Offline CLI compiles and validates JSON contracts. Conductor advances runs automatically based on evidence receipts.

### 2. Does an Editable Flow Builder Make Sense?

#### The Verdict: **Partially Yes, but the Current Mental Model is Inverted**

- **Why it makes sense:**
  - **Visual Interlock Verification:** For enterprise operators, compliance auditors, and safety engineers, visually seeing the dependency chain and where the human approval gate sits is irreplaceable. A flowchart is self-documenting in a way raw YAML or JSON never is.
  - **Live Progress Visualization:** Flow Control (`/flow`) with its animated flowing edges is an outstanding operational tool. It immediately communicates bottlenecks (e.g., three tasks blocked waiting for a slow build step).

- **Why an editable drag-and-drop canvas has severe friction:**
  - **The "Blank Canvas Problem":** Asking a user to drag boxes, invent IDs like `step-1`, memorize model roles, and drag crosshair wires between ports is 1990s CAD software UX. Modern users (especially mobile-native teens and busy managers) do not want to wire boxes.
  - **Duplication & Confusion:** Having two separate builders (`/console#workflows` vs `/flow#design`) creates confusion. They share the same underlying YAML schema but use completely different UIs.
  - **Recommendation for Redesign:**
    1. **Merge the surfaces:** Keep `/flow` as the single canonical Flow Control surface.
    2. **Conversational Prompt-to-Flow:** Replace manual box-dragging with a natural-language flow generator powered by Jev:
       > *"User types: 'Research open PRs, run tests, and if green, draft release notes and ask me to publish.' -> Jev automatically compiles the 4-step DAG with the approval gate pre-configured."*
    3. The visual canvas should be used for **reviewing and tweaking**, not building from scratch.

### 3. Score Data Available to Auto-Generate a Live Flowchart

BitCadence already maintains rich, deterministic data in its SQLite / PostgreSQL storage that can auto-generate a real-time flowchart without manual drawing:

| Data Element | Storage Source / Schema | Representation in Live Flowchart |
|---|---|---|
| **Nodes (Tasks / Goals)** | `score_tasks` / `score_documents.goals` | Visual node cards labeled with Goal ID and Title |
| **Dependencies** | `score_tasks.depends_on` (UUID or ID list) | Directed arrows connecting prerequisite nodes to dependents |
| **Execution States** | `score_tasks.status` | Real-time status coloring:<br>• `planned` / `waiting` (grey)<br>• `running` (pulsing blue)<br>• `review` (amber/purple)<br>• `checkpoint_waiting` (flashing gold ⏸)<br>• `accepted` / `completed` (solid green)<br>• `failed` (red) |
| **Resource Locks** | `score_tasks.resource_locks` | Lock badge on nodes sharing concurrency lanes (e.g., `repo-write-lane`) |
| **Assigned Workers** | `score_tasks.leased_by` / `score_providers` | Worker avatar / role chip on active node |
| **Budget & Progress** | `score_runs.authorized_budget_cents`, progress % | Top-level progress bar and cumulative cost meter |
| **Human Checkpoints** | `score_tasks.checkpoint == true` | Prominent shield icon or pause gate barrier on node |

---

### 4. APIs & Events Available for Live Updates

A live flowchart front-end can achieve zero-refresh reactivity using the following existing gateway interfaces:

1. **WebSocket Broadcast Feed (`/ws/broadcast`):**
   - Gateway broadcasts real-time JSON frames on every status change:
     ```json
     {
       "event": "status:completed",
       "job_id": "88f57ed8-4069-...",
       "actor_id": "codex-build-1",
       "created_at": "2026-10-03T12:25:00Z"
     }
     ```
   - Flowchart can update node border colors and trigger edge dash animations in <50ms.

2. **Job Event Stream API (`GET /api/jobs/{id}/events`):**
   - Returns the tamper-evident chronological event log for any task.

3. **Score Run Inspector (`GET /api/scores/runs/{run_id}`):**
   - Returns the complete state tree for an active autonomous run: tasks, attempts, grant status, and evidence digests.

4. **Score Events Stream (`GET /api/scores/{digest}/events`):**
   - Append-only event sequence for a score run, ideal for event-sourced diagram replay.

5. **Polling Fallback:**
   - If WebSocket is blocked by corporate proxies, `GET /api/jobs` or `GET /api/project-view` can be polled on an adaptive 4s / 30s interval.
