# Scheduling & Recurring Loops

## Goal
Automate recurring agent tasks on timers, cron schedules, or bounded iteration loops, ensuring all periodic runs inherit full governance, approval gates, and audit trails.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Initialize Scheduling Configuration
Generate the default schedules file in your user home:

```powershell
mco schedule init
```

This creates `~/.mco/schedules.yaml`.

### 2. Configure Launchers and Loops
Open `~/.mco/schedules.yaml` in your text editor:

```yaml
# Reusable launch templates
launchers:
  nightly-audit:
    role: reviewer
    title: Nightly dependency vulnerability audit
    instructions: Scan dependency lockfiles for known CVEs.
    requires_approval: false
    max_retries: 2
    escalate_to_role: human

  release-check:
    workflow: workflows/release-pipeline.yaml

# Timing and trigger loops
schedules:
  audit-cron:
    launcher: nightly-audit
    cron: "0 2 * * *"            # Runs every night at 02:00 UTC
    enabled: true

  health-pulse:
    launcher: nightly-audit
    interval_seconds: 3600       # Runs every hour
    max_iterations: 24           # Bounded loop: stops after 24 runs
    enabled: true
```

### 3. Inspecting and Testing Schedules
1. List all active schedules and their next fire timestamps:
   ```powershell
   mco schedule list
   ```
2. Test-fire a launcher manually to verify the prompt without waiting for cron:
   ```powershell
   mco launch nightly-audit
   ```
3. Run a dry run to simulate the next tick:
   ```powershell
   mco schedule tick --dry-run
   ```

### 4. Running the Scheduler Engine
Run the scheduler in the foreground:
```powershell
mco schedule run
```
Or install it as a persistent OS service:
```powershell
mco service install-scheduler
```

---

## The CLI Equivalent

Manage individual scheduled loops without rewriting YAML:

```powershell
# Disable a schedule temporarily
mco schedule disable audit-cron

# Re-enable a paused schedule
mco schedule enable audit-cron

# Reset iteration history for a completed loop
mco schedule reset health-pulse
```

---

## What You'll See

- **Governed Origin Stamps:** When a scheduled job is created on the Job Board, its metadata contains:
  ```text
  Origin: loop: audit-cron #12
  ```
- **Audit Trails:** You can look back months later and see exactly which schedule authorized each job, which agent leased it, and what was produced.

## If It Goes Wrong

### 1. "Invalid cron expression"
- **Cause:** Non-standard cron syntax.
- **Fix:** Use standard 5-part cron syntax (`minute hour day month day-of-week`).

### 2. "Schedule marked completed and stops running"
- **Cause:** The schedule reached its configured `max_iterations` limit.
- **Fix:** Run `mco schedule reset <name>` to clear the iteration counter, or remove `max_iterations` for infinite execution.
